For my final project I want to work with the BoxView API. I would like to build out a site that could work with the current site I am working with. I want to include the ability to sign up, upload a document that will display, and create a sorting mechanism. This is a dumbed-down version of a page we are currently working on, so I would like to have an idea of the work that goes into this type of page. Even if I cannot complete this page, I think it would be interesting to see how long it takes me.
