For my final project I want to create a website for my mother to sell her baked goods. I will use the google maps API so peopel can see how far away they are from stores selling these goods, and I would like to use the UPS APi so people can estimate shipping prices. 


As a user, I would like to view a list of available baked goods, So I can understand the scope of foods available.

As an authenticated user, I would like to estimate my shipping costs via the UPS API, so I am not suprised by the total cost of my order.

As a user, I would like the ability to view my location on google maps, So I can estimate my driving distance to the nearest place
